# Bicycle Manufacturing Performance and Trends Analysis

Welcome to the **Bicycle Manufacturing Performance and Trends Analysis** project! This repository contains analyses of various performance metrics and trends within a bicycle manufacturing company. The goal of this project is to provide insights into sales, customer retention, stock levels, and discounts, among other metrics, to help inform business decisions and strategies.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. **Calculate Quantity of Items, Sales Value, & Order Quantity by Each Subcategory in the Last 12 Months**
   - Determine the quantity of items sold, the total sales value, and the number of orders for each product subcategory in the last 12 months.

2. **Calculate % Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rate by Subcategory & Release Top 3 Categories with Highest Growth Rate**
   - Calculate the year-over-year growth rate for each subcategory using the metric `quantity_item`.
   - Identify and list the top 3 subcategories with the highest growth rates.
   - Round results to 2 decimal places.

3. **Rank the Top 3 TerritoryID with the Biggest Order Quantity Every Year**
   - Rank the top 3 TerritoryIDs based on order quantity for each year.
   - Ensure that if multiple TerritoryIDs have the same order quantity in a year, they share the same rank without skipping numbers.

4. **Calculate Total Discount Cost Belonging to Seasonal Discounts for Each Subcategory**
   - Compute the total cost associated with seasonal discounts for each subcategory.

5. **Calculate the Retention Rate of Customers in 2014 with Status of Successfully Shipped (Cohort Analysis)**
   - Perform a cohort analysis to determine the retention rate of customers who had orders successfully shipped in 2014.

6. **Analyze the Trend of Stock Level & Month-over-Month (MoM) Difference % by All Products in 2011**
   - Examine the stock levels and the month-over-month percentage difference for all products in 2011.
   - If the growth rate percentage is null, replace it with 0.
   - Round the percentage difference to 1 decimal place.

7. **Calculate the Ratio of Stock to Sales in 2011 by Product Name and by Month**
   - Calculate the ratio of stock to sales for each product by month in 2011.
   - Order the results by month (in descending order) and ratio (in descending order).
   - Round the ratio to 1 decimal place.

8. **Calculate the Number of Orders and Value at Pending Status in 2014**
   - Determine the number of orders and the total value of orders that were in a pending status in 2014.
